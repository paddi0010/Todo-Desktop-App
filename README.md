# Introduction

This is a simple Todo desktop app for Windows and was built with Electron. I'm planning a new design in the future, but I think this simple design is sufficient for now.


# How to use it

You can add a ToDo if you type a Text in the Text Field and add it with `Enter` or the Button `Hinzufügen`.

You can clear the List with the `Leeren` Button.

You see the List with you ToDo's. With the Button `Abgeschlossen` you can marker the ToDo in a green Color as finished. With the `in Arbeit` Button you can marker this ToDo as in Work with a orange Color. And with the `Löschen` Button you can delete the ToDo.

I have added a Dark Mode.. it's better for your Eyes :D
