# Introduction

This is a basic Todo Desktop App for Windows and was created with electron.


# Functions


This Todo app is in a table design, in the future i plan to expand this with a modern design with submenus.

- The `Status column` currently only shows a box which, when clicked on, marks the todo as completed; it has the same function as the Completed button

- The `Task column` displays the current todo in the form of text.

- The `Actions column` shows the available actions (Completed, In Progress, Delete)

- In the `Priority column` it is possible to set priorities, in which case high, medium and low are available.



# How to use it


# First Step


You have the option to create a todo in the text input field at the top and add it to the list by pressing Enter.
As described above, you can carry out actions in the different columns.
